<p align="center"><em>Rising Sun</em> is a song originally composed and performed by a very popular group known as TVXQ. Boys II Planet initiated a challenge in which team leaders will choose people they want to perform with (in their rank) and also choose the song they would like to perform. There are two groups performing the same song and <strong>the goal is to win in a 1v1 against the opposing team performing the same song as you, and to also win the 1v1 against the person who shares the same part as you</strong> <em>(ex. Main Vocal (Sun Hengyu) vs. Main Vocal (Yu Sen).</em><br>
    Rising Sun Team #1 won against Rising Sun Team #2.</p>
